# This service should be not needed for production nginx-ingress.
# But, minikube doesn't have nginx-ingress service.
# So, you will need to create this service externally
#
# And refer this service as in the following
#
#     http://ingress-nginx.kube-system.svc.cluster.local/api/users/currentuser
#
# Note that kube-system instead of ingress-nginx
